Hi all!

Cheers for looking at this development.

It is a simple Thick Client that works over the Internet to an IIS Server.

Web Comms are handled with an instance of the MS WebBrowser object so you
may need to change your EXPLORER SETTINGS to REFRESH EACH TIME in the tools.

I use EasyCGI to do all my stuff - essentially, they are inexpensive and fast.

Also, I do not need to set anything up each time.

They automatically create a folder off the ROOT called DB.

That is the folder the MDB needs to be dropped into.

The ASP pages just need to be dropped into the root.

You are free to use this software on my server indefinitely.

Enjoy!

Best regards,
Kevin Ritch
