### Description

***NEWS*** This has been compiled and tried by a client with Norton Anti... Guess what? It does NOT (repeat; NOT) come up with their usual jolly annoying window warning the user about an application trying to connect to the Internet.... AT LAST a neat WORKAROUND!!!... USE with confidence....

....There are 3 important features.

First, this VB front-end uses a silent WebBrowser object to work around security software objections.

Second, because all timestamps are stored in GMT format and reformatted when displayed, users can work in REAL-TIME.

Thirdly, because of the way that the back-end ASP manages the data, there is no limit to the number of people who may work with the database "simultaneously".
